    <p>Graduating from the Capital University Convservatory of Music, Daniel Kelly has

    established himself in the international music community, performing at arts and community

    festivals in the Midwest, and throughtout Europe with various acclaimed recording artists

    including Foley, former member of the Miles Davis Group.</p>

    <p>Daniel excels in performing a wide range of styles, notably jazz. salsa. classical and

    contemporary pop music. Classically trained on the piano since the age of six, his

    influences and experiences with theater, dance, and educational workshops including the

    &nbsp; &quot;Children of the Future&quot; program (where he worked with at-risk inner city

    children to teach and inspire through art and music activities) have culminated in

    futhering the development of his original music compositions. These new works have been

    performed in the United States and Europe, and are currently being recorded by his own

    quintet.</p>

    <p>He is the founder of the Avant-Collective, a progressive group of

    performers and composers that have come out of the tradition of John Zorn's

    improvised optical music. In 1999 they performed Zorn's <i>Cobra </i>and

    recorded their first cd. Zorn called it &quot;Some of the best new music he

    has heard.&quot; The Avant-Collective is currently performing gigs

    throughout the midwest and is planning performances in New York City.</p>
