            <p><font face="arial,helvetica" color="#ffffff" size="2"> They do 
              not teach you in school, that with a name like mine ( and the independence 
              of mind to match the name) that I could have ever become, let's 
              say a John Adams ( and I am not talking about style) or if I was 
              living in Germany a Wolfgang Rhim. No Cultural attache was looking 
              out for such a name.<br>
              <br>
              I paid my dues, but I refused to melt, that was the first thing 
              to happen to me. My life became a series of refusals. For years 
              I lived on 11 or 13 thousand dollars a year. I did not really plan 
              it that way. I could not even join the eccentric tradition of Partch 
              or Nancarrow because I was like Varese in reverse and by that I 
              mean rootless in my unmeltability. Actually for ten years I was 
              like a little Albert Schweitzer in reverse( studying the white culture 
              in the heartland's prisons).<br>
              <br>
              The Germans flattered me: "America you are a better place", but 
              I just saw that as more jostling hegemony between the big grid imposing 
              predators of Western Civilization. Acutally there was no category 
              for me that was officially recognized in the American experience 
              at the time. To be sure I was not alone; I either was indexed under 
              the Italian-American tradition and ignored or I fell into the great 
              wash of the marginals, in the shadow of the silent majorities at 
              the interstices of American life.</font></p>
            <p><font face="arial,helvetica" color="#ffffff" size="2"> Later this 
              would become a great lesson for me. Living in the states with few 
              opportunities for advanced music, I was unable to become what I 
              wanted to be. Instead I was forced to become what I am. It was yet 
              another reversal to which I owed this Nietzschean lesson, " become 
              who you are". Only after I died and lost music, after I traveled 
              across disciplines on the path of the creative life, did I arrive 
              at the crossroads of rediscovery. A musician without notes, undergoing 
              a series of spiritual crisises, I survived myself, and the music 
              came back.<br>
              <br>
              The model was <a href="http://www.fringeware.com/subcult/Georges_Bataille.html">Bataille</a>, 
              a librarian whose work was unclassifiable. I became a social worker 
              who rediscovered music, if not what some have called a social composer. 
              That is when I realized that 'style' is determined by what you cannot 
              play , or even refuse to play, in a complex web of reversals and 
              refusals. Style would grow like life does, as weeds in between dialectics.</font></p>
