        Di Pietro (b. 1949) studied piano and composition with Hans Hagen, Foss, 
        and Maderna. He was a Fellow of the Berkshire Music Center in 1971 and 
        also attended the Darmstadt courses. He earned degrees from SUNY Buffalo 
        and Vermont College. He is the author of three books: <i>The Normal Exception</i>, 
        <i>Dialogues with Boulez</i>, and <i>Musician without Notes</i>. He has 
        taught as “an inter-disciplinary adjunct professor…in prisons and on many 
        college campuses throughout New York, Ohio, and California,” including 
        touring California prisons as an artist-in-residence and holding artist 
        residencies at Ohio State, Stanford, Mills College, and SUNY Buffalo. 
        His works have been performed by the Buffalo and Brooklyn philharmonics, 
        St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, Bavarian Radio Orchestra, the Kronos Quartet, 
        and conductors Gunther Schuller, Dennis Russell Davies, and Christobal 
        Halffter, among others, and he has received grants and awards from ASCAP, 
        Meet the Composer, the Kennedy Center, Ohio Arts Council, etc., etc. I 
        had not encountered his music before, although I’ve owned his <i>Dialogues 
        with Boulez</i> for several years. This two-disc release includes recent 
        works going back to 1995 or even further, in that several incorporate 
        within them yet earlier works by the composer, folded into the mixture, 
        and re-readings, or improvisations on the written texts of prior works. 
        Di Pietro calls these re-readings “doubles” or “multiples,” which is the 
        explanation for some the piece titles above.</font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">In 
        a lot of ways, this music is hard to assess (but whose isn’t, really?). 
        Listening to these discs without having read the accompanying notes, I 
        found intriguing combinations of concrete and narrative sound-sources 
        with live accordion, piano, and other instruments, many of the pieces 
        seemingly trapped between music (as a time-based acoustic phenomenon), 
        theater (as a time-based narrative phenomenon), and ambient sound (some 
        complex sample-triggering wind-chime?). The composer’s often obscure comments 
        on the music are cratered with quotations from and references to the saints 
        of his aesthetic thinking: Henri Michaux, Foucault, Lyotard, Baudrillard, 
        Derrida, the deconstructive-poststructuralist-postmodern axis, the citation 
        of which is, for Di Pietro’s music, both illuminating and obfuscating. 
        It’s <i>illuminating</i> in that we’re made to realize that the composer 
        is aware of, and trying to draw on, different potential methods of apprehending 
        and applying meaning to the “texts” of his work, using (as a starting 
        point) the ideas of the primarily French, primarily last-generation) philosophical 
        avant-garde. It’s <i>obfuscating</i> in that we’re made to realize that 
        the composer is aware of, and trying to draw on, different potential methods 
        of apprehending and applying meaning to the “texts” of this work, using 
        (as a starting point) the ideas of the primarily French, primarily last-generation) 
        philosophical avant-garde.</font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Knowing 
        (/unknowing) what I do, having read Di Pietro’s comments, arguably put 
        in jeopardy my initial thoughts about the music itself, which aligned 
        the work with the American avant-garde of the 1960s and 70s, folks like 
        Alvin Lucier, Robert Ashley, Gordon Mumma, Steve Reich, and Ingram Marshall. 
        I don’t mean to imply a great connection here, but the above-mentioned 
        composers share with Di Pietro (on the evidence of the present collection) 
        an interest in combining electro-acoustic musical investigation with more-or-less 
        explicit social concerns. Whether this can be reconciled with the philosophical 
        context of Di Pietro’s self-commentary in his booklet notes is a matter 
        of perspective. In any event, I was somewhat surprised to hear this Maderna 
        and Foss pupil with an interest in Boulez writing music that sounds like 
        this music sounds, which is far removed (on the surface, anyway) from 
        the Boulez-Maderna-era Darmstadt avant-garde, and far removed from Foss’s 
        neo-Classic, traditionalist clarity. Of course, all three of these composers 
        were also concerned with incorporating indeterminate or improvisatory 
        elements into their work at one time or another. Di Pietro’s interest 
        in the dialogue between “intuition and pre-planning,” as he puts it, is 
        very much at issue here.</font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Finally, 
        to the pieces themselves. Of the two discs, I found the second one—Containing 
        <i>Wave Fugue with Electronic LOST, Chamber LOST<sup>2</sup></i>, and 
        <i>Mobile Phone Dreams</i> to be the more musically interesting. The two 
        latter pieces, both from 2002, contain a lot of ensemble improvisation 
        (echoes of Foss here?) spurred by relatively simple gestures—for example, 
        a long section in <i>Mobile Phone Dreams</i> in which trombone and piano 
        think aloud about a major second dyad, or a part later in the same work 
        in which piano and electric guitar take on a blues progression. In addition 
        to noise of recorded cell phones, their sounds are mimicked by the instruments, 
        a texture that acts as a kind of refrain separating improvised duos between 
        the pianist and one of the other players<i>. Chamber LOST<sup>2</sup> 
        for Christian Boltanski</i> is based in part on the monograms of actual 
        lost children, the names of which were taken from those little advertising 
        cards one gets in the mail: product on one side, tragedy on the other. 
        Di Pietro’s use of these initials doesn’t strike me as being at all cynical 
        or gimmicky, even as the actual musical context is pretty much<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>inaudible without a decoder ring. (Christian 
        Boltanski, incidentally, is a French conceptual artist whose often temporary 
        works and installations frequently make use of objects lost in public 
        spaces—railway stations and the like.)</font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Wave 
        Fugue with Electronic Lost</i> (2003) makes use of the composer’s piano 
        piece Wave from 1972, layering a performance of the piece (which is characterized 
        by rapid, changing patterns) one bar out of sync with a pre-recorded version 
        (hence “Wave Fugue”), and combining this with found and created taped 
        sounds, from voices to techno beats to a string quartet and other lost 
        sound objects. There’s more than a hint of classic minimalism in the Wave 
        background of this piece, and an interest in repeating figurations is 
        also to be found in several of the works on the first disc. A texture 
        of layered descending chromatic scales played real-time on piano is the 
        refrain of the fragment Tears of Eros (Torso Version B/Multiple—2001), 
        which is excerpted from a longer, larger work. This piano texture is combined 
        with many tracks of sex sounds, these episodes alternating with readings 
        from Bataille’s Guilty and Sam Mangwana’s Life (both cited at the start 
        of the piece). <i>In Deconstructed Fountain from Ravel with Derrida Watching</i>, 
        a ghostly taped music is commented upon in the foreground by real-time 
        piano music, variants of the same ascending arpeggio over eight minutes.</font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Chorale 
        Injured Bird/Multiple</i> (1997) and <i>Dead Sleeping Soldiers</i> (1995) 
        share musical material and ideas. Both incorporate what Di Pietro calls 
        “photos”—recordings of wild sound—crickets and a hearth fire in the former 
        and the ocean waves and wind in the trees in the latter. N addition, the 
        sharply articulated notes and chords of <i>Chorale Injured Bird</i> (the 
        title comes from Di Pietro’s son’s drawings of injured and dying birds) 
        reflect similar music played on synthesizer in the earlier work. <i>Dead 
        Sleeping Soldiers</i> was originally written for a site-specific installation 
        piece at an army barracks. The electronic keyboard is joined by a tape 
        of another keyboard, plus live accordion. (It’s in these two works, plus 
        <i>Deconstructed Fountain</i>, that Di Pietro’s music is at its most static.) 
        <i>Prison Dirges</i> (Model Version B – 1995) is a series of brief life 
        stories written by inmates, read and recoded by presumably other inmates, 
        over a background of live, probably mostly improvised accordion music 
        (played by the composer) and taped ambient electronic sound. While I like 
        the sound, what makes the piece compelling is the stories themselves, 
        which are unapologetically harsh, albeit also occasionally slightly self-congratulatory. 
        Apparently these and similar stores are the content of Di pIetro’s book 
        <i>The Normal Exception</i>.</font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">I’m 
        certainly cognizant of, if not completely immune to, the pitfalls of assessing 
        work of one kind using the values of another kind of work, but I suspect 
        what’s important to the composer is not whether I’m able to pick up on 
        a strong correlation between the music and his aesthetic ideas as stated 
        but whether or not the music itself makes for compelling listening. I 
        hope that I‘ve been able to get across how though provoking this release 
        has been for me. True, these pieces aren’t all equally successful as music, 
        or put another way, as listening experiences, but much of it is very intriguing, 
        particularly the three “LOST” pieces. This release, which goes by the 
        title “Multiples/The LOST Project,” is available from cdbaby.com and from 
        the Electronic Music Foundation (<a href="http://www.emf.org/">www.emf.org</a>).
