        </span>“What can you do with a sleeping audience?” asks Rocco di Pietro, 
        claiming not to care whether we’re there or not. <i>Fanfare</i> readers 
        might on the contrary claim to be more awake than most, when it comes 
        to new releases like this double CD introduction to his work. Yet there 
        can be few more intelligent and thought provoking voices in contemporary 
        music than di Pietro’s. His ideas and introspective writings go into poignant 
        territory, where others fear to tread. </font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>                
        </span>Di Pietro worked with Foss, Feldman, and Maderna, and his book 
        <i>Dialogues with Boulez</i> (Scarecrow Press, 2000) is credited with 
        being the only one that captures its subject’s tone of voice, and lines 
        of thought. It wasn’t written in a comfortable, or easy manner, di Pietro’s 
        life then being damned difficult, down, and broke – the occasional Boulez 
        interview in Chicago seeming incongruous in that context. He’s worked 
        in various non-creative or non-musical jobs, which he calls “white-washing,” 
        including the Prison Service. How to be an artist, or oneself at all, 
        when society says no, is a central theme. It’s that old quest for something 
        that feels real, despite everything, that links him to musicians across 
        the genres.</font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>                
        </span>Lately he’s called himself a musician without notes, a sound researcher; 
        but as usual from an artist with integrity, the musical results of this 
        abstraction are intensely personal. The background to the pieces on the 
        first of these CD’s is of the electro-acoustic variety: washes of sound, 
        including electronics, birds, insects, and then the ocean, in <i>Soldiers</i>. 
        This, however, is the New Age with its skin flayed off. <i>Dirges</i> 
        presents spoken life-accounts from those who’ve hit bottom, in stir. They 
        are well-nigh unbearable, thoughtful indictments of us all, read from 
        typescripts in a calm manner; commentary from di Pietro’s expressive accordion. 
        This may recall Partch and others but it leaves you well out of the zone.</font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>                
        </span>Having softened us up, but inflamed our sense of social outrage, 
        and personal helplessness, di Pietro’s next two absorbing electro-instrumentals 
        prepare us for the X-rated rondo that is <i>Tears of Eros</i>. It’s the 
        final part of a trilogy for radio, interspersing Bataille’s writings on 
        love, sex and unknowing with the processed, recoded sound of many men 
        and women together on the home stretch, love-making-wise. The punctuating 
        sound between the sections is a lot like the little bell Stockhausen used 
        in <i>Telemusik</i>, and the repeated coupling noises end up seeming mysterious 
        and abstract in the context of the words. This is a far cry from <i>Let’s 
        Get It On</i>. Try headphones, however, for a unique 11-minute electronic 
        orgy inside and around your head, with intellectual musing thrown in. 
        <i>Deconstructed Fountain</i> offers relief from all the intensity, however 
        existentially ironic, and di Pietro’s seven minutes of attractive, rolling 
        keyboard lines suggest someone should ask him to write non-ironic film 
        scores now. </font></p>
      <p class=MsoNormal><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>                
        </span>Eros probably means the <i>Multiples</i> CD in not for children, 
        but <i>The Lost Project</i> is all about them. Musically, it’s a vigorous 
        “overture” for piano and background, followed by two 25-minute suites 
        for ensemble, in five movements each. The thematic material derives from 
        the musical notes contained in the names of lost or missing children, 
        identified on official cards. Each of the 10 pieces is named after the 
        appropriate child. The great French artist Christian Boltaknski’s name 
        is invoked by di Pietro because of his various “lost” projects, whether 
        assemblages of lost property or the distribution at stations of photos 
        of children “lost” in the Holocaust. His installations of lights, photographs, 
        and filing boxes must be the most involving reminders in the visual arts 
        today of mortality, of human evil, and of the lost child in us all. These 
        conceptual aspects get much more emotionally entwined than they might 
        in di Pietro’s work; the way the mobile phones ring at the start of the 
        second suite, then grow into voices, and the piano responses are alarming 
        and rivet the attention. You have to think about your world, the child 
        issues, and respond to the art at the same time, while trying to compare 
        what you’re doing with the regular musical modes you engage in. The world 
        seems a different place after the music has stopped. The groups are hot 
        improvisers, notably Brian Casey on trombone – and things sometimes tend 
        gently towards contemporary jazziness. I guess it’s a modernist project, 
        uncomfortable and “free,” but the textures can be beautiful. The emotional 
        tug is surprisingly strong; the sense of horror, aloneness, and sometimes 
        panic is powerful. But you do need an ear for semi-improvised group work 
        and not-always-pretty things like this in general.</font></p>

        </span>Boltanski said, famously, with regard to commissioning institutions 
        and galleries: “They give me money and I give them nothing.” The reference 
        was to the impermanence of his works – and us! If you pay your money and 
        I listen to di Pietro’s CDs, especially <i>Multiples</i>, then you’ll 
        certainly confront nothingness, not to say joyless despair, at some stage. 
        But the vortex of notes, words, and ideas sucks the listener into its 
        heart. Some part of the true blood and bone of modern life echoes from 
        your loudspeakers. Rocco di Pietro is onto something, and it is recognizably 
        human by nature. </font> </td>
