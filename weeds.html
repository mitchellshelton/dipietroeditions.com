        The Weeds Of Dialectics</strong> </font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">They do not 
        teach you in school, that with a name like mine (and the independence 
        of mind to match the name) that I could have ever become, let's say a 
        John Adams (and I am not talking about style) or if I was living in Germany 
        a Wolfgang Rhim. No Cultural attache was looking out for such a name.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I paid my 
        dues, but I refused to melt, that was the first thing to happen to me. 
        My life became a series of refusals. For years I lived on 11 or 13 thousand 
        dollars a year. I did not really plan it that way. I could not even join 
        the eccentric tradition of Partch or Nancarrow because I was like Varese 
        in reverse and by that I mean rootless in my unmeltability. Actually for 
        ten years I was like a little Albert Schweitzer in reverse (studying the 
        white culture in the heartland's prisons).</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Germans 
        flattered me: &quot;America you are a better place&quot;, but I just saw 
        that as more jostling hegemony between the big grid imposing predators 
        of Western Civilization. Acutally there was no category for me that was 
        officially recognized in the American experience at the time. To be sure 
        I was not alone; I either was indexed under the Italian-American tradition 
        and ignored or I fell into the great wash of the marginals, in the shadow 
        of the silent majorities at the interstices of American life.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Later this 
        would become a great lesson for me. Living in the states with few opportunities 
        for advanced music, I was unable to become what I wanted to be. Instead 
        I was forced to become what I am. It was yet another reversal to which 
        I owed this Nietzschean lesson, &quot; become who you are&quot;. Only 
        after I died and lost music, after I traveled across disciplines on the 
        path of the creative life, did I arrive at the crossroads of rediscovery. 
        A musician without notes, undergoing a series of spiritual crisises, I 
        survived myself, and the music came back.</font></p>
      <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The model 
        was Bataille, a librarian whose work was unclassifiable. I became a social 
        worker who rediscovered music, if not what some have called a social composer. 
        That is when I realized that 'style' is determined by what you cannot 
        play , or even refuse to play, in a complex web of reversals and refusals. 
        Style would grow like life does, as weeds in between dialectics.</font></p>
